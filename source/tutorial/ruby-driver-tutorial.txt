Authentication
--------------

MongoDB supports a variety of `authentication mechanisms <http://docs.mongodb.org/master/core/access-control/>`_.

For more information about configuring your MongoDB server for each of these authentication mechanisms please see MongoDB's `online documentation <http://docs.mongodb.org/master/tutorial/enable-authentication>`_.

Creating a user
```````````````

A user can be created in a database by calling ``create`` on the users view with the name, password, and roles (optional).

.. code-block:: ruby

  client.database.users.create(
        'durran',
        password: 'password',
        roles: [ Mongo::Auth::Roles::READ_WRITE ])

Providing credentials
`````````````````````

As is the case for all authentication mechanisms, credentials are either provided at instantiation of the client or when a new client is created via the ``with`` method.

.. code-block:: ruby

  client = Mongo::Client.new([ '127.0.0.1:27017' ],
                             user: 'test',
                             password: '123')

For MongoDB 2.6 and higher, ``:auth_source`` defaults to **admin**, otherwise the current database is used.

The current database can be changed using the client's ``use`` method.

.. code-block:: ruby

  client = Mongo::Client.new([ '127.0.0.1:27017' ])
  client.use('music')

Then a new client can be created with the authentication credentials.

.. code-block:: ruby

  client.with(user: 'test',
              password: '123')

Alternatively, setting the current database and credentials can be done in one step:

.. code-block:: ruby

  client.with(database: 'music',
              user:'test',
              password:'123')


MONGODB-CR mechanism
````````````````````

MONGODB-CR was the default authentication mechanism for MongoDB up through version 2.6.

The mechanism can be explicitly set with the credentials.

.. code-block:: ruby

  client = Mongo::Client.new([ '127.0.0.1:27017' ],
                             database: 'music',
                             user: 'test',
                             password: '123',
                             auth_mech: :mongodb_cr)


MONGODB-X509 mechanism
``````````````````````
*Requires MongoDB v2.6 or greater.*

The MONGODB-X509 mechanism authenticates a username derived from the distinguished subject name of the X.509 certificate presented by the driver during SSL negotiation. This authentication method requires the use of SSL connections with certificate validation.

For more information about configuring X.509 authentication in MongoDB, please see `this tutorial <http://docs.mongodb.org/master/tutorial/configure-x509/>`_.

.. code-block:: ruby

  client = Mongo::Client.new([ '127.0.0.1:27017' ],
                             auth_mech: :mongodb_x509,
                             ssl: true,
                             ssl_cert: '/path/to/client.pem',
                             ssl_ca_cert: '/path/to/ca.pem') )


SASL PLAIN (LDAP) mechanism
```````````````````````````
*Requires MongoDB Enterprise Edition v2.6 or greater.*

MongoDB Enterprise Edition supports the SASL PLAIN authentication mechanism which allows you to delegate authentication using a Lightweight Directory Access Protocol `LDAP <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LDAP>`_ server. When using SASL PLAIN, passwords are sent to the server in plain text. For this reason, we strongly recommend enabling SSL when using SASL PLAIN as your authentication mechanism.

For more information about configuring SASL PLAIN authentication in MongoDB, please see `this tutorial <http://docs.mongodb.org/master/tutorial/configure-ldap-sasl-authentication/>`_.

.. code-block:: ruby

  client = Mongo::Client.new([ '127.0.0.1:27017' ],
                             auth_mech: :plain,
                             ssl: true,
                             ssl_verify: true,
                             ssl_cert: '/path/to/client.pem',
                             ssl_ca_cert: '/path/to/ca.pem')

GSSAPI (Kerberos) mechanism
```````````````````````````
*Requires MongoDB Enterprise Edition v2.4 or greater.*

MongoDB Enterprise Edition v2.4+ supports GSSAPI (Kerberos) authentication.

In order to use GSSAPI in the Ruby driver with **JRuby**, you must do the following:

1. Specify several system properties so that the underlying GSSAPI Java libraries can acquire a Kerberos ticket. Please see `this documentation <http://docs.mongodb.org/ecosystem/tutorial/authenticate-with-java-driver/#kerberos-authentication>`_ for more information.

2. Either provide a password OR set the 'java.security.auth.login.config' system property to a config file that references a keytab file.

In order to use the GSSAPI authentication mechanism in the Ruby driver with **MRI**, you must do the following:

1. Create a ticket-granting ticket using kinit. Please see `this documentation <http://linux.die.net/man/1/kinit>`_ for more information.

For more information about deploying MongoDB with Kerberos authentication, please see `this documentation <http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/tutorial/control-access-to-mongodb-with-kerberos-authentication/>`_.

.. code-block:: ruby

  client = Mongo::Client.new([ '127.0.0.1:27017' ],
                             auth_mech: :gssapi,
                             user: 'test',
                             password: '123')


Read Preferences
----------------

Read preferences determine the candidate replica set members to which a query or command can be sent. They consist of a **mode** specified as a symbol, an array of hashes known as **tag_sets**, and two timing options: **local_threshold** and **server_selection_timeout**.

``local_threshold`` defines the upper limit in seconds of the latency window between the nearest server and suitable servers to which an operation may be sent. The default is 15 milliseconds, i.e. 0.015 seconds.

``server_selection_timeout`` defines how long to block for server selection before throwing an exception. The default is 30,000 milliseconds, i.e. 30 seconds.

For more information on the algorithm used to select a server, please refer to `this documentation <https://github.com/mongodb/specifications/blob/master/source/server-selection/server-selection.rst>`_.

The read preference is set as an option on the client or passed an option when a command is run on a database.

.. code-block:: ruby

  # Set read preference on a client, used for all operations
  client = Mongo::Client.new([ '127.0.0.1:27017' ],
                             read: { mode: :secondary,
                                     tag_sets: [{ 'dc': 'nyc' } ]
                                    })

  # Set read preference for a given command
  database.command({ collstats: 'test' }, read: { mode: secondary,
                                                  tag_sets: [{ 'dc': 'nyc' }  })

Mode
````

There are five possible read preference modes. They are ``:primary``, ``:secondary``, ``:primary_preferred``, ``:secondary_preferred``, ``:nearest``. Please see `this documentation <http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/core/read-preference/>`_ for an explanation of the modes and tag sets.

Tag sets
````````

The ``tag_sets`` parameter is an ordered list of tag sets used to restrict the eligibility of servers for selection, such as for data center awareness.

A read preference tag set (T) matches a server tag set (S) – or equivalently a server tag set (S) matches a read preference tag set (T) — if T is a subset of S (i.e. T ⊆ S).

For example, the read preference tag set ``{ dc: 'ny', rack: 2 }`` matches a secondary server with tag set ``{ dc: 'ny', rack: 2, size: 'large' }``.

A tag set that is an empty document matches any server, because the empty tag set is a subset of any tag set. This means the default ``tag_sets`` parameter ``[{}]`` matches all servers.
